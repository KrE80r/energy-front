================================================================================\nMETHODOLOGY COMPARISON ANALYSIS REPORT\n================================================================================\n\nTesting claims from alternative methodology against mathematical reality...\n\nPERSONA: Commuter (No Solar)\n==================================================\nCLAIM: Lower supply charge beats GloBird lower peak rate\nCLAIMED WINNER: Origin Energy\nMETHODOLOGY: Supply charge prioritization for high peak users\n\nACTUAL RESULTS:\n  Mathematical Winner: Energy Locals ($522.25)\n  Claimed Winner Position: #2 ($692.34)\n  Cost Difference: $170.09 quarterly ($680.34 annually)\n  ❌ CLAIM REFUTED\n\nRATE IMPACT REALITY CHECK:\n  1. Peak Cost: $56.13 per 10% increase\n  2. Daily Supply Charge: $10.71 per 10% increase\n  3. Off Peak Cost: $8.48 per 10% increase\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nPERSONA: Work From Home (No Solar)\n==================================================\nCLAIM: Shoulder rate is most critical + lowest supply charge\nCLAIMED WINNER: Origin Energy\nMETHODOLOGY: Shoulder rate prioritization for WFH users\n\nACTUAL RESULTS:\n  Mathematical Winner: Energy Locals ($597.25)\n  Claimed Winner Position: #2 ($782.82)\n  Cost Difference: $185.56 quarterly ($742.26 annually)\n  ❌ CLAIM REFUTED\n\nRATE IMPACT REALITY CHECK:\n  1. Peak Cost: $57.74 per 10% increase\n  2. Shoulder Cost: $15.15 per 10% increase\n  3. Daily Supply Charge: $10.71 per 10% increase\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nPERSONA: Commuter + Solar\n==================================================\nCLAIM: High 9c FiT makes usage rates almost irrelevant\nCLAIMED WINNER: AGL\nMETHODOLOGY: Feed-in tariff dominance for high exporters\n\nACTUAL RESULTS:\n  Mathematical Winner: Energy Locals ($448.75)\n  Claimed Winner Position: #4 ($643.35)\n  Cost Difference: $194.60 quarterly ($778.42 annually)\n  ❌ CLAIM REFUTED\n\nRATE IMPACT REALITY CHECK:\n  1.
